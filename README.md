CovidSafe is a tool built by doctors and researchers at the University of Washington with Microsoft volunteers to alert you about highly relevant public health announcements, exposure to COVID-19, and to assist contact tracing without compromising your personal privacy.

Here is an [overview video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=2fPpLJ3MQpc) (1:17) demonstrating how users are notified of potential exposures and announcements<br/>

Our app also has a [symptom tracker and location log](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Pr1YNAiKmFg) (1:13) which are useful for aggregating information for public health officials and contact tracers<br/>

Health care workers and public health officials can send public service announcements to bounded geographic regions using Google Forms, here is a [video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mweXe470Mrs) (0:40). For more details for how to do this, check out this [repo](https://github.com/covidsafe/hcp-tools)

To run an end-to-end demo of the app on your own phone, please refer to [these instructions](https://github.com/covidsafe/App-Android/wiki/Running-the-app) in our wiki.

Our tool is built upon the following white paper:<br/>
